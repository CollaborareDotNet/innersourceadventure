In the spirit of InnerSource, it's now time to discuss with others!

Whip up a repo out of your project and push it to Github. 

Hint: if git/github is new to you, try out the git-it workshopper, found here: https://nodeschool.io#workshopper-list

Afterwards, get with one or more of the other attendees and discuss InnerSource with them based on what you all have done with and learned from your repos.

  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` to verify/validate this final step.
