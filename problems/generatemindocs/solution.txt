The four documents are:

   -- README.md is for improved findability; name, description, earlier names of projects, keywords, announcements about builds, releases, bugs and performance issues; information about discussion lists.

   -- HELPWANTED.md links to the rally backlog, issues, abandoned code; includes a ranking system (easy, intermediate, hard)

   -- GETTINGSTARTED.md explains how one can get started with running the application, installing and using a component, or building and using a library, etc.

   -- CONTRIBUTING.md - all the requirements; acts like a Contribution Licensing Agreement (CLA); written set of expectations between groups.
