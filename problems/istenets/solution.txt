SOLUTION
--------------------------------------------------
The five (5) tenets are: 

1) Faster development: Programmers use unit tests, code coverage, and continuous integration to remove bugs at early stages

2) Complete documentation: Code is documented better, both in-code comments and less formally on discussion lists

3) Code reuse: Programmers across the organization understand the code and architecture of modules developed by other teams

4) Cross-team collaboration: Contributions by members outside of the team are frictionless and rarely have to be rewritten

5) Development with GitHub: GitHub maintains private repositories for in-house projects as well as public repositories for open source code
